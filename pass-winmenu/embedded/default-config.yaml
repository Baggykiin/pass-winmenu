# Here you can map hotkeys to various actions. Supported actions are:
# - decrypt-password
# - add-password
# - git-pull
# - git-push
# Actions can be further configured using the 'options' variable. 
# Valid options for 'decrypt-password' are:
# - copy-to-clipboard: (true/false)
# - type-username: (true/false)
# - type-password: (true/false)
# The other actions currently have no configurable options.
#
# The default configuration has one hotkey for copying the password to your
