# pass-winmenu
dmenu-inspired Windows interface for pass

# Usage

Press Ctrl-Alt-P to open the password menu.

## Configuration

On first run the application will generate a pass-winmenu.yaml file 
(containing all its settings initialised to their default value) in its current directory. 
Edit the file and restart the application to apply the changes.

## Known issues

- Opening the menu seems to occasionally crash it after it has been running for a while. (Possibly fixed, needs testing)
