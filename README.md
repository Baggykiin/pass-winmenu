# pass-winmenu

A simple, easy-to-use password manager for Windows.

Pass-winmenu follows the philosophy of (and is compatible with) the Linux password manager [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org), which defines an open standard for password management that's easy to extend and customise to your personal requirements.

## Introduction

[Pass (https://www.passwordstore.org)](https://www.passwordstore.org) stores passwords as GPG-encrypted files organised into a directory structure.
Its simplicity and modularity offer many advantages, most importantly:

- Cryptography is handled by GPG, an open-source, high quality security suite trusted and used by
  security analysts, journalists, Linux distributions and many other parties all over the world
- The use of open standards makes it easy for anyone to develop compatible password managers
  for any platform they like (Linux, Android, Windows, Mac OS, etc)
- Because the passwords are simply stored as encrypted files in directories, you can organise them
  with your file manager and synchronise them across your devices using whatever method you prefer
  (Git, Dropbox, Nextcloud, etc).
- The passwords are securely encrypted with your own GPG keys, which can only be unlocked with
  your master password. Even if someone manages to acquire your encrypted passwords and your GPG keys,
  they won't be able to do anything unless they have your master password.

Unfortunately, while there are many Linux integrations available, Windows integrations are more scarce.

I wasn't happy with the existing ones, so I created my own, focusing on easy, keyboard-friendly
interaction and a minimal interface that stays out of your way.

## Usage

Bring up the password menu with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl Alt P`.
The password menu allows you to quickly browse through your passwords and select the right one.
Select the right password file by double-clicking it, or by using the arrow keys and pressing Enter.

The password will be decrypted using GPG, and your GPG key passphrase may be requested through pinentry.
The decrypted password will then be copied to your clipboard and/or entered into the active window,
depending on your `pass-winmenu.yaml` settings.

## Configuration

Pass-winmenu can be configured using the `pass-winmenu.yaml` configuration file located next to the `pass-winmenu.exe` executable.
If this file does not exist, a new one, containing the default settings, can be generated by starting the application.

## Dependencies

Pass-winmenu is built against .NET Framework 4.5.2, which should already be installed on every version
of Windows since Windows 7.

Git support is provided by LibGit2Sharp, which requires some native dependencies which are contained within the
release builds.

For convenience, the release builds also contain a portable GPG installation, which pass-winmenu uses by default.
If you already have GPG installed, you may want to use that instead. In that case, you can download the
`nogpg` release, which will use your native GPG installation.

## Installation

Installing pass-winmenu is as easy as downloading the zip file for the [latest release](https://github.com/Baggykiin/pass-winmenu/releases) and extracting it anywhere you want. It is recommended that you download the regular release, unless you already have GPG installed and accessible from your commandline. In that case you can also use the `nogpg` release. A [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/pass-winmenu) is also available.

If this is your first time using `pass`, you'll want to create a password store and import/create your GPG keys next.
This process is explained below.

### Setting up GPG:

If you already have a GPG key, you may want to consider importing it and using that (see ['accessing an existing password store on a different host'](
#accessing-an-existing-password-store-on-a-different-host)).
If you've never used GPG before, you can generate a new key. Start pass-winmenu, right click the key icon
in the notification area, and click `Open shell`.

This will open a PowerShell window in which you'll be able to set up your GPG keys.
Start by generating a new key:

```
powershell> gpg --gen-key
```

Follow the instructions to generate your GPG keys. If it asks you what kind of keys
you want to generate, don't pick any of the `sign only` options, as they don't
include an encryption key, which is required for encrypting passwords.
The default, RSA and RSA, is recommended.

When it asks you for an email address, remember that address, as you'll need to enter
it again in a bit.

Finally, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase. Make sure this is a very secure,
unique passphrase, as it can be used to decrypt all your passwords, but don't
make it *too* hard  to enter, since you'll need to enter it regularly.

### Creating a new password store:

Determine in which directory you want to store your passwords.
By default, pass-winmenu will assume it's `%USERPROFILE%\.password-store`.
If you want to use that directory, create it:
```
powershell> mkdir $HOME\.password-store
```

Save the email address you used for creating your GPG key into a `.gpg-id` file
in the root of your password directory.
```
powershell> echo "myemail@example.com" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $HOME\.password-store\.gpg-id
```

If you've used a different location for your password store directory, you'll have to point pass-winmenu to it.
Open `pass-winmenu.yaml` in the directory where you've installed the application, and set the `password-store`
variable to the correct location. Exit pass-winmenu (right click the icon > Quit), and start it again.

You should now have a working password manager.

### Password synchronisation

If you want to access your passwords on multiple devices, you have several options.
What follows are the instructions for setting up Git, but all software 
able to synchronise directories will work: Git, SVN, Dropbox, Google Drive, ownCloud, network shares, bittorrent sync...


To synchronise your passwords using Git, initialise a new Git repository at the root of your password store:
```
powershell> cd $HOME\.password-store
powershell> git init
powershell> git add -A
powershell> git commit -m "Initialise password repository"
```

You'll also need a remote Git server. GitLab offers free private repositories, and GitHub does too if
you're a student. Alternatively, you can of course run your own Git server.

Add an empty repository on your Git provider of choice, then connect your password store to it.
Depending on where you're hosting your repository, it might differ a bit, but you'll usually
have to do something like this:

```
powershell> git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/password-store.git
powershell> git push --set-upstream origin master
```

### Accessing an existing password store on a different host

If you already have a password store and you want to access it from another computer, you'll have
to import your GPG keys on it. Follow the above instructions for installing GPG and Git, then export
your GPG keys on the machine where you already have a working password store:

```
powershell> gpg --export-secret-key -a youremailaddress@example.com > private.key
```

Copy the `private.key` file to the machine on which you're setting up your password store, and import it.

```
powershell> gpg --import private.key
```

Now, set the key validity so that it can be used to decrypt your password files.

```
powershell> gpg --edit-key youremailaddress@example.com
gpg> trust
```

Set the trust level to `5` (ultimate trust) and save your key.
```
gpg> save
```

Clone your password repository

```
powershell> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-store.git $HOME/.password-store
```

Then run pass-winmenu, edit the generated `pass-winmenu.yaml` configuration file as necessary,
and start it again.

## Cross-platform support

Check out https://www.passwordstore.org/#other if you're looking for implementations for other operating systems.

Personally, I use [Android Password Store](https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store) for Android, and [a dmenu script](https://geluk.io/p/passmenu.sh) for Linux, which I've adapted from [this script](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/dmenu).
